**Freedom**: As time goes by, online service providers control pretty much everything we listen to.
Complicated copyright issues make things worse.
If my favorite song cannot be found on a website, I'll probably just not listen to them for years.

**Free of charge**: You can download from YouTube, NetEase, Migu and KuGou for free.
No need to register for monthly paid memberships.

As a contributor of [GOMU](https://github.com/issadarkthing/gomu), I met serious problems during development. The main problem is data race condition.
So I rewrote the player in rust, and hope to solve the problem.

## Supported Formats

Below are the audio formats supported by the various backends.

In the case that metadata is not supported, an attempt will still be made to play the file.

There are extra features for some backends:
Note that they are not enabled by default and potentially increase non-rust dependencies.

|      Feature       | Backend |                            Description                            | Extra Dependencies |
| :----------------: | :-----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------: |
|    `rusty-simd`    | `rusty` |                     Enable SIMD instructions                      |                    |
| `rusty-soundtouch` | `rusty` | Enable `soundtouch` compilation and use as default speed-modifier |                    |
|  `rusty-libopus`   | `rusty` |         Enable `libopus` support to support `opus` files          |     `libopus`      |

#### Album cover support

To display covers in the terminal itself, feature `cover` can be enabled.
To only enable specific protocols for cover support, see [tui/Cargo.toml#features](./tui/Cargo.toml).

Feature `cover-ueberzug` will require some ueberzug implementation to be present at runtime.

### Official Install Sources

#### Cargo

```bash
cargo install termusic termusic-server --locked
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tramhao/termusic.git
cd termusic
make
```

Then install with:

```bash
make install
```

By default, termusic can display album covers in Kitty or iTerm2.
If you need album covers displayed on other terminals, you can enable the `sixel` protocol or use a ueberzug implementation(x11/xwayland only).

To build all backends and all cover protocols and install them in your home:

```bash
make full
```

Finally, you can run it with:

```bash
~/.local/share/cargo/bin/termusic
```

To build with all backends and all cover protocols without copying binaries elsewhere:

```bash
make all-backends
```

### Unofficial Install Sources

The following are ways to install termusic, but may differ in configuration and support.

They are not maintained by the termusic project itself.

#### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install `termusic` from the [official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/termusic) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman).

```bash
pacman -S termusic
```

#### Arch Linux GIT (AUR)

Arch Linux users can install [`termusic-git` from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/termusic-git) using [pamac](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pamac-cli).

```bash
pamac install termusic-git
```

#### NetBSD

NetBSD users can install `termusic` from the official repositories.

```bash
pkgin install termusic
```

#### Nix/NixOS

Either in the user's environment:

```bash
nix-env --install termusic
```

Or declaratively in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
    environment.systemPackagess = with pkgs; [
      ...
      termusic
    ];
}
```

## TODO

- [ ] Better interface to adjust timestamp of lyric.
- [ ] Rating and sync support.
- [x] Multiple root and easy switch.
- [x] Save playlists.
- [x] Listen to rss feeds/Podcasts. Need a new layout.
