Files in this directory are vendored from some upstream project with slight modifications.
Licenses of those projects apply to those files and should be included as a header.

All files that are vendored are expected to:
- include the license header (and be compatible with this project's license)
- include a version / commit of when it was taken from
- a reason for vendoring
